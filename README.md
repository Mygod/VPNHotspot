This app is useful for:

* Connecting things that don't support VPN like Chromecasts behind corporate firewalls;
* Setting up [gapps](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158475) behind corporate firewalls;
* Connecting to your mobile hotspot but you're not bothered to set up VPN on your device;
* Bypassing tethering limits. (you might need more of a real VPN than an ad-blocker to fool a smarter cellular provider)

P.S. You can also do the similar on [Windows](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/share-vpn-connection-windows/)
and [Mac](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/vpn-setup/share-vpn-connection-mac/).
I don't know about you but I can't get my stupid Windows 10 to work with
[hosted network](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd815243(v=vs.85).aspx)
now that they introduced this
[Mobile hotspot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027762/windows-use-your-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot).

This app is designed to do only minimal changes to your system, so there's almost no chance you will brick your device
and/or break your Internet using this app *under normal conditions*. However there's also absolutely no guarantee it won't.

## Q & A

Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Mygod/VPNHotspot/issues) for more.

### Failed to create group due to internal error/repeater shuts down after a while?

This could caused by the Wi-Fi channel you selected is no longer available, due to:

1. Your device doesn't support operating on this channel, or
2. There is some nearby Wi-Fi direct device that broadcasted that it can't operate on the channel you picked.

For maximum stability, you need to set channel = 0 so that your device will pick a channel automatically.
You can also use WPS to connect your 2.4GHz-only device to force the repeater to switch from 5GHz to 2.4GHz for this time.

### No root?

Without root, you can only:

* View connected devices for system tethering and monitor them;
* Toggle tether switches if you can't do it already;
* Play around with settings and the user interface in general;
* Alternatively you can use try these apps (requires manual proxy configuration or client apps) for normal repeater
  tethering/bypassing tethering limits: (note: these apps are neither free nor open source)
